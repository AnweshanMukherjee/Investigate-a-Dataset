# Investigate-a-Dataset
Analyse a dataset using Python libraries.
## Project Overview
In this project, we will analyse a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

## About the Dataset
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. 
•	‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. 
•	‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
•	‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
•	We need to be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
